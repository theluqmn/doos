- `TASK(id INT PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, status INT)`

## to-do

very ironic.

- [ ] figure out how this system will work
- [ ] build the basics (procedures, CLI handler)
- [ ] add task into list
- [ ] sort based on date
- [ ] show overdue

## extras

the main objective of building this project is to learn and implement date and time using cobol.
