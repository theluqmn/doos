CLI-based to-do system

## features

## how to use

## how this works

### file system design

- `TASK(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (8), name TEXT (32), date TEXT (32), status INTEGER)`
- `LOG(num INTEGER PRIMARY KEY (8), details TEXT (32), date TEXT (32)`

## to-do

very ironic.

- [ ] figure out how this system will work
- [ ] build the basics (procedures, CLI handler)
- [ ] add task into list
- [ ] sort based on date
- [ ] show overdue

## extras

the main objective of building this project is to learn and implement date and time using cobol.
